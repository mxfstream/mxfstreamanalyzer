# Cinegy MXFstream Analyser Tool

Use this tool to view inbound metadata, network, RTP and TS packet details. 

## How easy is it?

Just run the EXE from inside a command-prompt, and you will be offered a basic interactive mode to get cracking checking out your stream.

You can print live Teletext decoding, and you can use the tool to generate input logs for 'big data' analysis (which is very cool).

## Command line arguments:

Double click, or just run without (or with incorrect) arguments, and you'll see this:

```
TODO
```

The help details for the 'stream' verb look like this:

```

```

Just to make your life easier, we auto-build this using AppVeyor - here is how we are doing right now:
